# ha-pve
ProxmoxVE custom component (adds storage sensors) based on the [native integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/proxmoxve/). Mostly a temporary solution since YAML changes are no longer allowed until I can make my [pull request](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/36983) acceptable, but maybe it will stick around longer if people like it.

Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/libots/ha-pve) for setup information (but it's basically like the built-in integration).
